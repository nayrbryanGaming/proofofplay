# PROOF OF PLAY

## Games Don’t Need Servers

Proof of Play is not a game.
It is a proof.

This repository demonstrates that real gameplay can run entirely on-chain — without backend servers, without databases, and without trusted intermediaries.

Every action is a transaction.
Every state change lives on Solana.
Everything is verifiable.

The “Dungeon” is intentionally minimal.
It exists only to make the system observable.

Built PSG1-first for Play Solana.

## THE CLAIM

Most on-chain games are still Web2 games with a wallet attached.

Proof of Play removes the Web2.

- No backend
- No database
- No off-chain logic
- No hidden state

The blockchain is the game engine.

## WHAT THIS PROVES

If the frontend disappears, the game still exists.

- Game logic lives in an **Anchor program**
- State lives in **PDAs**
- Equipment is **Metaplex metadata**
- Rewards are **Jupiter swaps**

No servers.
No APIs.
No trust assumptions.

## THE LOOP (ON-CHAIN)

**Init → Explore → Fight → Claim**

Each step:

1. Executes on Solana
2. Produces a transaction
3. Can be inspected on Explorer

This is gameplay as a public system.

## WHY PSG1-FIRST

Handheld devices need simple, deterministic systems.

- Portrait-first
- Large touch targets
- Stateless frontend
- Short sessions
- Immediate feedback

This is what blockchain-native gaming looks like on mobile hardware.

## THE DIFFERENCE

| Feature | Typical Hackathon Game | Proof of Play |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Backend** | Required | **None** |
| **Database** | Required | **None** |
| **Game Logic** | Server-side | **On-chain** |
| **State** | Private | **Public** |
| **Verifiability** | Limited | **Absolute** |

This does not compete on graphics.
It competes on truth.

## THE POINT

Games can be fully on-chain.
State does not require databases.
Logic does not require servers.

Transparency is not a feature.
It is the default.

## CLOSING

Proof of Play is not about how games look.
It’s about what games are allowed to be.
